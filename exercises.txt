Flask Framework

1. Create Flask project
 - Read the documentation for Flask
 - Create a new project
 - Set env variable
 - Run project


Front End

1. JS Events
 - Handle button click events with JS
 - Html button
 - Create JS function which will be executed on click

2. DOM Manipulation
 - Get element with JS
 - Create element with JS
 - Modify Element with JS (i.e. add child)

3. AJAX Request
 - Create request to the server with (XMLHttpRequest)
 - Get the response from the request

4. Implement some behavior (getting some data)
 - Create button
 - Handle click with JS
 - Make request to the server
 - Get the response and visualize it in the DOM
   - Create element and fill the data inside
   - Add element to the DOM or to some existing element


Back End

1. Create routes (methods with their urls)
 - Create methods with the @app.route attribute
 - Test them with going to the specific route and
   checking if it returns the expected result

2. Make a request to external API
 - Create method in the project which will send request to the external API
 - Get the response and return it as a result


Wrap everything together

1. Front end part
 - html page using some JS script file which is fetched from the server
 - Create the dynanmic part of the page (using the JS file)
   - Create function which will be executed when interacting with the DOM (i.e. clicking on buttons)
 - Make requests for fetching data from the server (in these functions)

2. Back end part
 - Create the needed routes/methods
 - Return some random/mocked data
 - Make methods for handling static files
   - when requesting static files (.js, .css)
   - define some rule for getting files only for the directory storing
     the static files

3. API part
 - Create some rules/methods for fetching data from external API (i.e. Wiki)

Then you can fetch the data through the JS functions which will make 
requests to the server. The server will make another request in order
to fetch this data from an external API.
